                            Also known as the Alsatian, this is the second-most
                            popular breed of
                            dog in the United States. Poor training or poor
                            socialization can make
                            them prone to attack humans and smaller dogs, and
                            their considerable jaw
                            strength can exert over 300 pounds of biting force.

                            Probably the most notorious breed on this list, the
                            pit bull has a
                            reputation for unpredictability and aggression, even
                            against its owner or
                            his family. State and local governments have been
                            vigorous in restricting
                            ownership of this dog with breed-specific
                            legislation. They were
                            originally bred as fighting dogs, and the breed is
                            still known for
                            strength, aggression, and persistence in attacking.
                            Pit bulls are
                            responsible for most fatal dog attacks on adults
                            aged 21 to 54.
